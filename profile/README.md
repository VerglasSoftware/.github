# Verglas

Hey! We're a new startup based in Northern Ireland, developing software solutions to add competitive edge to the classroom and promote technology and programming to the next generation. Our company consists of a team of 17-18 year old students, with the goal of giving students the same opportunities to get into the industry and make likeminded friends that we were given.

Our main project in development is a capture-the-flag/quiz platform tailored towards computer science classes, allowing teachers to spend less time testing to gain more insightful analytics on how well their students are learning. We're aiming to begin beta testing for our platform during Q4 2023.

We're most well known for organizing the annual [IglooCode](https://iglooco.de) programming competition for 13-15 year olds at Queen's University, in partnership with [Kainos](https://kainos.com) and [Liberty IT](https://www.liberty-it.co.uk/about-us/overview). Our last event in Belfast welcomed over 100 aspiring programmers from 16 schools across the country.

Verglas Software Limited is a company registered in England and Wales (no. 14838037). Verglas and/or IglooCode is not associated with Slemish College or Strathearn School, and any publications from us do not represent their views.
