# Verglas

Hey! We're a new startup based in Northern Ireland, developing software solutions to add competitive edge to the classroom and promote technology and programming to the next generation. 🌍📖 Our company consists of a team of 17-18 year old students, with the goal of giving students the same opportunities to get into the industry and make likeminded friends that we were given. 👨‍💻🤝

Our main project in development is a capture-the-flag/quiz platform tailored towards computer science classes, allowing teachers to spend less time testing to gain more insightful analytics on how well their students are learning. 👩‍🏫📈 We're aiming to begin beta testing for our platform during Q4 2023. 🎓📊

We're most well known for organizing the annual [IglooCode](https://iglooco.de) programming competition for 13-15 year olds at Queen's University, in partnership with [Kainos](https://kainos.com) and [Liberty IT](https://www.liberty-it.co.uk/about-us/overview). 🧒🥈 Our last event in Belfast welcomed over 100 aspiring programmers from 16 schools across the country. 🚌🏆
